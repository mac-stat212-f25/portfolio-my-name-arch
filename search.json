I realized that there are certain comments that are left on days. So I was curious, whether these comments bear any effect on the amount observed. I did not include the record observations because I know that they will obviously have a higher average number of observations.\nSo what this graph shows me is that the days when there is severe interference or an uncertain amount, we can expect a very high count, but the ends of the season do not see that many observations on average. This makes a bit of sense because logically,because at the borders of the season, it is probably a lot futher from the peak of the season which I would expect to be in the middle of the season. I was a bit surprised at how high severe interference and uncertain amount are.",

Using both the small thumbnail visuals on the right and the names of the geom’s, brainstorm some possibilities for geom’s you might use to recreate the temperature visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating Documentation / Reference Pages\n\n\n\nYou need to navigate the geoms further by opening up their reference pages to understand if a particular geom is suitable for our task. Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot(). However, multiple data sets can be passed into ggplot as shown in the example below.\n\nCodedata(diamonds)\n\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds |&gt;\n  group_by(carat) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  arrange(carat)\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds_avg_price[seq(1, nrow(diamonds_avg_price), 3), ]\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = diamonds_avg_price,\n    aes(x = carat, y = avg_price),\n    color = \"deepskyblue\",\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the geom_linerange documentation page and start off your temperature visualization with the record lows and highs. Your plot should look like the one below. The hex code of the used light tan color is #ECEBE3.\n\n\nSFO Weather Records in 2011\n\n\nCodeggplot(weather) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\n\n\nAs you work on this plot, try to use some new keyboard shortcuts. Focus on the following:\n\nInsert code chunk: Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows). Option+Command+I (Mac).\nRun current code chunk: Ctrl+Shift+Enter (Windows).

Press “Next” or type n to run the next line of code. Type the name of an object in the Console to see its value at this point in the function. You can type Q to quit the browser.\n\nExample below:\n\n\n\n\nCodefit_mod_and_extract &lt;- function(data, yvar, preds, pred_of_interest) {\n    # Use str_c to create a string (formula_str) that looks like \"yvar ~ pred1 + pred2\"\n    # Look at the documentation for a helpful argument\n    mod_formula_str &lt;- str_c(yvar, \"~\", str_c(preds, collapse = \"+\"))\n    mod_form &lt;- as.formula(mod_formula_str)\n    \n    # Add browser() to where in the function you'd like to pause and interact in the function environment using the Console\n    browser()\n    \n    # Fit a linear model using the constructed formula and given data\n    mod &lt;- lm(mod_form, data = data)\n    \n    # Obtain 95% confidence interval\n    ci &lt;- confint(mod, level = 0.95)\n    \n    # Return the coefficient estimate and CI for the predictor of interest\n    tibble(\n        which_pred = pred_of_interest,\n        estimate = mod$coefficients[pred_of_interest],\n        ci_lower = ci[pred_of_interest, \"2.5 %\"],\n        ci_upper = ci[pred_of_interest, \"97.5 %\"]\n    )\n}\n\n\nfit_mod_and_extract(data = mtcars, yvar = \"mpg\", preds = c(\"hp\", \"wt\"), pred_of_interest = \"hp\")\n\n\n\nUse try() to catch errors and print out a message when an error occurs.\n\nExample below:\n\n\n\n\nCodeMy_own_sum &lt;- function(x){\n  return(sum(x))\n}\n\nresults &lt;- My_own_sum(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"))\n\nError in sum(x): invalid 'type' (character) of argument\n\nCodeclass(results)\n\nError: object 'results' not found\n\nCoderesults &lt;- try(My_own_sum(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")), silent = TRUE)\nclass(results)\n\n[1] \"try-error\"\n\n\n\nInclude if else statements within a function to ensure that you are passing the right type of input to a function. You can create you own custom error message with stop().\n\nExample below:\n\n\n\n\nCodeMy_own_sum &lt;- function(x){\n  if(!is.numeric(x)){\n    stop(\"Input must be numeric\")\n  }\n  return(sum(x))\n}\n\nresults &lt;- My_own_sum(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"))\n\nError in My_own_sum(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")): Input must be numeric\n\nCodeclass(results)\n\n[1] \"try-error\"\n\nCoderesults &lt;- try(My_own_sum(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")), silent = TRUE)\nclass(results)\n\n[1] \"try-error\"",

    "text": "Functions and Control Structures\nWhy functions?\nGetting really good at writing useful and reusable functions is one of the best ways to increase your expertise in data science. It requires a lot of practice.\nIf you’ve copied and pasted code 3 or more times, it’s time to write a function. Try to avoid repeating yourself.\n\n\n\nReducing errors: Copy + paste + modify is prone to errors (e.g., forgetting to change a variable name)\n\nEfficiency: If you need to update code, you only need to do it one place. This allows reuse of code within and across projects.\n\nReadability: Encapsulating code within a function with a descriptive name makes code more readable.\n\n\nCore parts of a function\nWhen you define a function, what does it look like?\n\nCode# Defining a function\nfunction_name &lt;- function(input_name_1, input_name_2 = default_value_2){\n\n  # function body - code that does something\n\n  return(output)\n}\n\n# Calling a function (all valid ways)\nfunction_name(input_name_1 = 2, input_name_2 = 4)\nfunction_name(2, 4)\nfunction_name(input_name_2 = 4, input_name_1 = 2)\nfunction_name(2)\n\n\nThe core parts of defining a function include:\n\n\nfunction() directive\n\nThis is what allows tells R to create a function.\n\n\n\nArguments/Inputs: the input_name_1 and input_name_2 – these are names of the function inputs\n\n\ndefault_value_2 is a default value that is used if no input values are provided when the function is called\n\n\n\nFunction body\n\nThe code inside the curly braces { } is where all the work happens. This code uses the function arguments to perform computations.\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\nWe can explicitly return an object by putting it inside return().\n\n\n\nHere are three examples that can help us learn a few properties of functions:\n\nCodeaverage &lt;- function(x, remove_nas) {\n    return(sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x))\n}\naverage2 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n    return(sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x))\n}\n\naverage3 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas) {\n    sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x)\n}\n\n\nNote:\n\nIn average2, the remove_nas argument has a default value of TRUE.\n\nWhen a function has default values for arguments, they don’t have to be provided when you call the function if you want to use the default value. See below:\n\nCode# Does throw an error\naverage(c(1, 2, 3, NA))\n\nError in average(c(1, 2, 3, NA)): argument \"remove_nas\" is missing, with no default\n\nCodeaverage(c(1, 2, 3, NA), remove_nas = TRUE)\n\n[1] 1.5\n\nCode# Doesn't throw an error\naverage2(c(1, 2, 3, NA))\n\n[1] 1.5\n\nCodeaverage2(c(1, 2, 3, NA), remove_nas = FALSE)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\nIf we don’t provide a return(), the last value that gets evaluated in the function body and isn’t stored as an object is what the function returns. (This is generally the last line without an assignment operator &lt;-.)\n\n\naverage3() is one example, but this can easily lead to errors.\nWe should explicitly return an object by putting it inside return().",

    "section": "Scope",
    "text": "Scope\nIn programming, scope refers to the area of a program where a named object is recognized and can be used.\n\nR uses lexical scoping, which means that the scope of a variable is determined by where it is created in the code.\n\nLexical scoping in R:\n\nWhen code refers to an object (e.g. data set, function, vector, etc.), R looks for the object in the current, local environment.\nIf it doesn’t find it, it continues to search by looking in the parent environment, and so on. The top-level environment is the global environment, the location where all interactive (i.e. outside of a function) computation and storage takes place.\n\nIf you save an object in R, outside a function local environment, it is stored in the global environment.\n\n\nIf R can’t find it in the global environment, it will look for it in loaded packages.\n\nWhen writing and using functions, the local environment is within the function itself.\n\nIf you define an object in the function, it won’t be accessible outside that function (unless you pass it as the output). See below:\n\n\nCodeaverage_new &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n    sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x)\n  fun_new_thing_within_function &lt;- \"Fun times!\"\n}\naverage_new(1:3)\nfun_new_thing_within_function\n\nError: object 'fun_new_thing_within_function' not found\n\n\nScoping is important to consider if you try to refer to objects that aren’t passed as arguments.\n\nThis can be dangerous because if you re-use names of variables, it is easy to accidentally refer to a variable that is not the one you intended. See below:\n\n\nCodev &lt;- c(1,2,3)\n\naverage_new2 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n    sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x) + v\n}\n\n\naverage_new2(1:3)\n\n[1] 3 4 5\n\nCodev &lt;- c(4,5,6)\naverage_new2(1:3)\n\n[1] 6 7 8\n\n\nAnything created/saved/updated within a function that you want accessible outside that function needs to be passed to return(). See below:\n\nCodev &lt;- c(1,2,3)\n\naverage_new3 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n  v &lt;- v + 10 # this is not changing v outside the function... \n  return(sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x) )\n}\n\naverage_new3(1:3)\n\n[1] 2\n\nCodev\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nFor more about lexical scoping in R, see R Programming for Data Science",

The navigator oversees and provides guidance.\nFor the first exercise, the person whose birthday is coming up sooner will be the driver first. Swap role for the second exercise and continue in this manner for all exercises.\n\n\n\nRescaling function Write a function that rescales a numeric vector to be between 0 and 1. Here are some test cases with the expected output. Test out your function on the following inputs:\n\n\n\nx = 2:4. Expected output: 0.0 0.5 1.0\n\n\nx = c(-1, 0, 5).

(Pull up the documentation on ggplot with ?ggplot in the Console.) So the following doesn’t work:\n\nCodeggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price), diamonds) + geom_point()\n\nError in `ggplot()`:\n! `mapping` must be created with `aes()`.\n✖ You've supplied a tibble.\n\n\nBut if we named the arguments (name matching), we would be fine:\n\nCodeggplot(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), data = diamonds) + geom_point()\n\n\nSomewhat confusingly, we can name some arguments and not others. Below, mapping is named, but data isn’t. This works because when an argument is matched by name, it is “removed” from the argument list, and the remaining unnamed arguments are matched in the order that they are listed in the function definition.

We can see the exact recycling that happens below:\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 2, 9, 4)\nx == c(1, 2, 4)\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\nCodex == c(1, 2, 4, 1) # This line demonstrates the recycling that happens on the previous line\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nLogical vectors can also be created with functions. is.na() is one useful example:\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 4, 9, NA)\nx == NA\n\n[1] NA NA NA NA\n\nCodeis.na(x)\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nWe can negate a logical object with !. We can combine logical objects with & (and) and | (or).\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 2, 4, 9)\nx &gt; 1 & x &lt; 5\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\nCode!(x &gt; 1 & x &lt; 5)\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nCodex &lt; 2 | x &gt; 8\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nWe can summarize logical vectors with:\n\n\nany(): Are ANY of the values TRUE?\n\nall(): Are ALL of the values TRUE?\n\nsum(): How many of the values are TRUE?\n\nmean(): What fraction of the values are TRUE?\n\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 2, 4, 9)\nany(x == 1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nCodeall(x &lt; 10)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nCodesum(x == 1)\n\n[1] 1\n\nCodemean(x == 1)\n\n[1] 0.25\n\n\nif_else() and case_when() are functions that allow you to return values depending on the value of a logical vector. You’ll explore the documentation for these in the following exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: ifelse() (from base R) and if_else() (from tidyverse) are different functions. We prefer if_else() for many reasons (examples below).\n\nNoisy to make sure you catch issues/bugs\nCan explicitly handle missing values\nKeeps dates as dates\n\n\nExamples\n\nCodex &lt;- c(-1, -2, 4,

    "section": "Factors",
    "text": "Factors\nNotes\nCreating factors\nIn R, factors are made up of two components: the actual values of the data and the possible levels within the factor. Creating a factor requires supplying both pieces of information.\n\nCodemonths &lt;- c(\"Mar\", \"Dec\", \"Jan\",  \"Apr\", \"Jul\")\n\n\nHowever, if we were to sort this vector, R would sort this vector alphabetically.\n\nCode# alphabetical sort\nsort(months)\n\n[1] \"Apr\" \"Dec\" \"Jan\" \"Jul\" \"Mar\"\n\n\nWe can fix this sorting by creating a factor version of months. The levels argument is a character vector that specifies the unique values that the factor can take. The order of the values in levels defines the sorting of the factor.\n\nCodemonths_fct &lt;- factor(months, levels = month.abb) # month.abb is a built-in variable\nmonths_fct\n\n[1] Mar Dec Jan Apr Jul\nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nCodesort(months_fct)\n\n[1] Jan Mar Apr Jul Dec\nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\nWhat if we try to create a factor with values that aren’t in the levels? (e.g., a typo in a month name)\n\nCodemonths2 &lt;- c(\"Jna\", \"Mar\")\nfactor(months2, levels = month.abb)\n\n[1] &lt;NA&gt; Mar \nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\nBecause the NA is introduced silently (without any error or warnings), this can be dangerous. It might be better to use the fct() function in the forcats package instead:\n\nCodefct(months2, levels = month.abb)\n\nError in `fct()`:\n! All values of `x` must appear in `levels` or `na`\nℹ Missing level: \"Jna\"\n\n\nReordering factors\nWe’ll use a subset of the General Social Survey (GSS) dataset available in the forcats pacakges.\n\nCodedata(gss_cat)\nhead(gss_cat)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n   year marital         age race  rincome        partyid     relig denom tvhours\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1  2000 Never married    26 White $8000 to 9999  Ind,near r… Prot… Sout…      12\n2  2000 Divorced         48 White $8000 to 9999  Not str re… Prot… Bapt…      NA\n3  2000 Widowed          67 White Not applicable Independent Prot… No d…       2\n4  2000 Never married    39 White Not applicable Ind,near r… Orth… Not …       4\n5  2000 Divorced         25 White Not applicable Not str de… None  Not …       1\n6  2000 Married          25 White $20000 - 24999 Strong dem… Prot… Sout…      NA\n\n\nReordering the levels of a factor can be useful in plotting when categories would benefit from being sorted in a particular way:\n\nCoderelig_summary &lt;- gss_cat |&gt;\n    group_by(relig) |&gt;\n    summarize(\n        tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE),\n        n = n()\n    )\n\nggplot(relig_summary, aes(x = tvhours, y = relig)) + \n    geom_point() +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use fct_reorder() in forcats.\n\nThe first argument is the factor that you want to reorder the levels of\nThe second argument determines how the factor is sorted (analogous to what you put inside arrange() when sorting the rows of a data frame.)\n\n\nCodeggplot(relig_summary, aes(x = tvhours, y = fct_reorder(relig, tvhours))) +\n    geom_point() +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor bar plots, we can use fct_infreq() to reorder levels from most to least common. This can be combined with fct_rev() to reverse the order (least to most common):\n\nCodegss_cat |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(x = marital)) +\n    geom_bar() +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodegss_cat |&gt;\n    mutate(marital = marital |&gt; fct_infreq() |&gt; fct_rev()) |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(x = marital)) +\n    geom_bar() +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifying factor levels\nWe talked about reordering the levels of a factor–what about changing the values of the levels themselves?\nFor example, the names of the political parties in the GSS could use elaboration (“str” isn’t a great label for “strong”) and clean up:\n\nCodegss_cat |&gt; count(partyid)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   partyid                n\n   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;int&gt;\n 1 No answer            154\n 2 Don't know             1\n 3 Other party          393\n 4 Strong republican   2314\n 5 Not str republican  3032\n 6 Ind,near rep        1791\n 7 Independent         4119\n 8 Ind,near dem        2499\n 9 Not str democrat    3690\n10 Strong democrat     3490\n\n\nWe can use fct_recode() on partyid with the new level names going on the left and the old levels on the right. Any levels that aren’t mentioned explicitly (i.e., “Don’t know” and “Other party”) will be left as is:\n\nCodegss_cat |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        partyid = fct_recode(partyid,\n            \"Republican, strong\"    = \"Strong republican\",\n            \"Republican, weak\"      = \"Not str republican\",\n            \"Independent, near rep\" = \"Ind,near rep\",\n            \"Independent, near dem\" = \"Ind,near dem\",\n            \"Democrat, weak\"        = \"Not str democrat\",\n            \"Democrat, strong\"      = \"Strong democrat\"\n        )\n    ) |&gt;\n    count(partyid)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   partyid                   n\n   &lt;fct&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;\n 1 No answer               154\n 2 Don't know                1\n 3 Other party             393\n 4 Republican, strong     2314\n 5 Republican, weak       3032\n 6 Independent, near rep  1791\n 7 Independent            4119\n 8 Independent, near dem  2499\n 9 Democrat, weak         3690\n10 Democrat, strong       3490\n\n\nTo combine groups, we can assign multiple old levels to the same new level (“Other” maps to “No answer”, “Don’t know”, and “Other party”):\n\nCodegss_cat |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        partyid = fct_recode(partyid,\n            \"Republican, strong\"    = \"Strong republican\",\n            \"Republican, weak\"      = \"Not str republican\",\n            \"Independent, near rep\" = \"Ind,near rep\",\n            \"Independent, near dem\" = \"Ind,near dem\",\n            \"Democrat, weak\"        = \"Not str democrat\",\n            \"Democrat, strong\"      = \"Strong democrat\",\n            \"Other\"                 = \"No answer\",\n            \"Other\"                 = \"Don't know\",\n            \"Other\"                 = \"Other party\"\n        )\n    )\n\n# A tibble: 21,483 × 9\n    year marital         age race  rincome        partyid    relig denom tvhours\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n 1  2000 Never married    26 White $8000 to 9999  Independe… Prot… Sout…      12\n 2  2000 Divorced         48 White $8000 to 9999  Republica… Prot… Bapt…      NA\n 3  2000 Widowed          67 White Not applicable Independe… Prot… No d…       2\n 4  2000 Never married    39 White Not applicable Independe… Orth… Not …       4\n 5  2000 Divorced         25 White Not applicable Democrat,… None  Not …       1\n 6  2000 Married          25 White $20000 - 24999 Democrat,… Prot… Sout…      NA\n 7  2000 Never married    36 White $25000 or more Republica… Chri… Not …       3\n 8  2000 Divorced         44 White $7000 to 7999  Independe… Prot… Luth…      NA\n 9  2000 Married          44 White $25000 or more Democrat,… Prot… Other       0\n10  2000 Married          47 White $25000 or more Republica… Prot… Sout…       3\n# ℹ 21,473 more rows\n\n\nWe can use fct_collapse() to collapse many levels:\n\nCodegss_cat |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        partyid = fct_collapse(partyid,\n            \"Other\" = c(\"No answer\", \"Don't know\", \"Other party\"),\n            \"Republican\" = c(\"Strong republican\", \"Not str republican\"),\n            \"Independent\" = c(\"Ind,near rep\", \"Independent\", \"Ind,near dem\"),\n            \"Democrat\" = c(\"Not str democrat\", \"Strong democrat\")\n        )\n    ) |&gt;\n    count(partyid)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  partyid         n\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Other         548\n2 Republican   5346\n3 Independent  8409\n4 Democrat     7180\n\n\nExercises\n\nCreate a factor version of the following data with the levels in a sensible order.\n\n\nCoderatings &lt;- c(\"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\")\n\n\nMore exercises will be on HW4.",
