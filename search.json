    "text": "Exercise 2\nNavigate the Geoms section of the ggplot2 reference page to find a geom that corresponds to the visual elements in the temperature plot. Using both the small thumbnail visuals on the right and the names of the geom’s, brainstorm some possibilities for geom’s you might use to recreate the temperature visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating Documentation / Reference Pages\n\n\n\nYou need to navigate the geoms further by opening up their reference pages to understand if a particular geom is suitable for our task. Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot(). However, multiple data sets can be passed into ggplot as shown in the example below.\n\nCodedata(diamonds)\n\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds |&gt;\n  group_by(carat) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  arrange(carat)\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds_avg_price[seq(1, nrow(diamonds_avg_price), 3), ]\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = diamonds_avg_price,\n    aes(x = carat, y = avg_price),\n    color = \"deepskyblue\",\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the geom_linerange documentation page and start off your temperature visualization with the record lows and highs. Your plot should look like the one below. The hex code of the used light tan color is #ECEBE3.\n\n\nSFO Weather Records in 2011\n\n\nCodeggplot(weather) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\n\n\nAs you work on this plot, try to use some new keyboard shortcuts. Focus on the following:\n\nInsert code chunk: Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows). Option+Command+I (Mac).\nRun current code chunk: Ctrl+Shift+Enter (Windows). Command+Shift+Return (Mac).\nRun current line/currently selected lines: Ctrl+Enter (Windows). Command+Return (Mac).",
